{"header":[],"response_header":[],"description":"An order stores all the information needed by a pipeline to achieve works. In particular, an order has a list of \nitems which are used and a status. Items map a role to a resource (like a plate or a tube). A role informs how \nan item participates in the order. A status represents the progress of the order from an end-user point\nof view. A status is meant to be used in order related application, not by the pipeline. Typically, when the\npipeline interacts with the order, its status should be `in_progress`. Here is the different status for an order: \n\n* `draft` this is the initial state on order creation\n* `pending` after a `build` event. The order has been validated by the user and is ready to be used\n* `in_progress` after a `start` event. The order has been started, it belongs to a pipeline and works are in progress\n* `completed` after a `complete` event. The order has been fulfilled with success. The order cannot be modified.\n* `cancelled` after a `cancel` event. The order has been cancelled by the user. The order cannot be modified.\n* `failed` after a `fail` event. The order cannot be completed for some reason. The order cannot be modified.\n\nOn top of that, each item in an order gets a status which represent its progress. It can be one of the following: \n\n* `pending` which is the initial state of an item or after a `reset` event.\n* `in_progress` after a `start` event. Some work are on-going using the item.\n* `done` after a `complete` event. The item is available to be used in a new pipeline step.\n* `cancelled` after a `cancel` event. The item has been cancelled by the user.\n* `failed` after a `fail` event. The item cannot be done for some reason.\n\n--\n"}
