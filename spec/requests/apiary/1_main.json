The path to the root URL `/` only is needed to interact with the API.\nAll the other actions are embedded in every JSON response.\nPlease note that all URLs are to be considered unstable. As a consequence, you should only refer to the actions\nelements returned in the response.\n\nPlease find below the different actions available in the JSON:\n\n* `create` creates a new resource using a HTTP POST request\n* `read`, `first` and `last` actions are used for pagination through HTTP GET requests\n* `update` action update a resource using a HTTP PUT request\n* `delete` action delete a resource using a HTTP DELETE request\n\nIn top of the above actions, more specific actions are available to interact between multiple resources.\nThese actions use generally HTTP POST request and are listed under the root JSON response (for example `/actions/tube_rack_transfer`).\n\nPlease note you will generally find two different URLs to create a new resource, which produce an identical result:\n`/resources` or `/actions/create_resource`.\n---\n"}
